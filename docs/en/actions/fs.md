If necessary, it creates directories.

      - from: root
        to: .
      - from: test.json
        to: config/.test.json
      - from: back-config
        to: back/config
```

* the content of the directory `/recipe/root` to `/project/`;
* the file `/recipe/test.json` to `/project/config/.test.json`, renaming the file `test.json` to `.test.json` and, if
  necessary, creating the directory `/project/config/`;
* the directory `/recipe/back-config` and its content to `/project/back/config`, renaming the directory `back-config` to
  `config` and, if necessary, creating the directory `/project/back/`.

## Deleting Files and Directories (delete)
